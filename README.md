<h3>📜</h3>
<p>
I have over four years of experience working at SAP on cloud CPQ systems, where I have contributed to the development of this technology. I have also personally designed and developed a microservice for the cloud CPQ system.

Beyond my work at SAP, I have gained additional experience working on freelance projects, such as https://politicki-kompas.svarog-0.dev. I am driven by challenging problems and innovative solutions, and I thrive on exploring new technologies.

My primary skillset expertise in C#, Javascript/Typescript, and Angular, but I dabble in Nodejs and Golang also. I am particularly interested in working on distributed systems.

When I'm not working, I enjoy pursuing my passions for cooking and travel.
